### How to get started?

1. Download Tutorial_EPMA_2023.zip from the <a href="https://cloud.metp.ch/index.php/s/idQ2DtEcg7PPT94" target="_blank">download center</a>.
2. Unzip the folder in a suitable working directory (e.g. Documents/Mapping/EPMA/__Tutorial_EPMA_2023/__)
3. Open XMapTools. Note that starting XMapTools can take up to a minute; restarting the program is slightly faster
When the program is ready, a dialog box opens; pick the working directory __Tutorial_EPMA_2023__ and click the button "Open". You can change the working directory later, but you need to pick a directory when you start the program. A log file is automatically created in the selected working directory.

### Import maps

1. In the first workspace "PROJECT & IMPORT", click on the "Import" button (Import Maps) to open the Import Tool module. <img src="/assets/323-add.png" alt="drawing" width="18"/>
2. Select all the map files to be imported and click on the button "Open". Note that you can select all the text files available in the folder and XMapTools will find out which ones can be imported as maps.
3. In the tab "Corrections", change the value of dwell time to 120 ms. 
4. Press the "Import Data" button. 

### X-ray data visualization (Part 1)

1. Quickly go through the maps and use the auto-contrast option or the live frequency polygon (see figure bellow) to adjust the lower and upper limits of the color bar. Note that the color bar settings are available in the "Options" workspace. <img src="/assets/XXX_magic-wand.png" alt="drawing" width="18"/>
2. Eliminate the maps which are not needed because they do not contain any important information (Ce, Cr, Ni, S). To eliminate a map, select the map in the primary tree menu, then right click on the name and select "Delete".
3. Save your project using either the "Save" button available in the "PROJECT & IMPORT" workspace or in the menu "File" > "Save Project". <img src="/assets/022-save.png" alt="drawing" width="18"/>

### Classification

Classification is the step used to create a classified image in which each pixels are attributed to a class (mineral, glass, epoxy, etc.). In this tutorial we are using the random forest algorithm. The classification in XMapTools is supervised. You need to create a "training set" containing training data for each class. 

Additional information about the classification in XMapTools can be found in : Lanari, P., Tedeschi, M., (2025). Chemical map classification in XMapTools. _Applied Computing and Geosciences_, __25__, 100230 [<a href="https://pierrelanari.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_LanariTedeschi_ACG.pdf" target="_blank">Download</a>].

1. Set the active workspace to CLASSIFY.
2. Create a new training set. In the secondary tree menu, select the category "Training Set (Classification)" and press the button "Add" available in the CLASSIFY workspace to add phase definitions. Select in the list the phases: Biotite, Garnet, Plagioclase, Quartz; then click "Apply". <img src="/assets/323-add.png" alt="drawing" width="18"/> 
3. Add training data for each phase:
     - Select a training class in the training set.
     - Adjust display (optional): select an element to be display and eventually use the zoom and pan features to adjust the field of view. <img src="/assets/XXX_zoom_in.png" alt="drawing" width="18"/> <img src="/assets/XXX_controller.png" alt="drawing" width="18"/>
     - Select a ROI type in the dropdown menu among "Rectangle ROI", "Polygon ROI", "Ellipse ROI" and "Circle ROI".
     - Finally, press the "Add a ROI" button and immediately click and drag (or click for polygon) over the map to create the ROI. How to draw a ROI in XMapTools: <img src="/assets/323-add.png" alt="drawing" width="18"/> 
       - Rectangle: click to select the first corner and drag the mouse to the opposite corner defining a rectangle.
       - Polygon: click successively on the image to draw a polygon; right-click or double-click to validate and close automatically the shape.
       - Ellipse: click to select the first point and drag the mouse to a second point defining the long axis of an ellipse.
       - Circle: click to select the first corner of a square and drag the mouse to opposite corner defining a circle.
4. Edit the shape of a ROI by selecting the ROI in the secondary tree menu. __If the editing mode is disabled, press once the "Ctrl" key on your keyboard and try again editing the shape of the ROI__.
5. You can eliminate a ROI by first selecting the ROI in the secondary tree menu and then right clicking on its name and selecting "Delete".
6. Add new phase definitions for sillimanite and sudoite (low temperature chlorite here replacing cordierite). Add training data for each phase (see step 3 above).  
7. Restore the view using either the button "Reset Zoom & Pan"  or the button "Restore view" available near the top-right corner of the main figure. 
8. In classification parameters: 
     - Add all maps in the list for classification. Select an element to display in the primary tree menu and use the "Add all" button to add all maps at once. <img src="/assets/323-add.png" alt="drawing" width="18"/>
     - Eliminate La from the list; select La_EDS in the primary tree menu and press the button "Take La_EDS out". <img src="/assets/057-minus.png" alt="drawing" width="18"/>
     - You can calculate PCA maps using the "Generate Maps of the Principal Component" button. The maps of principal components are listed in the category "Other" available in the primary tree menu. <img src="/assets/004-picture.png" alt="drawing" width="18"/>
     - Select the data type "Maps" (other data types are described in Lanari & Tedeschi 2025).
     - Select the map scaling method "Robust"; select the option "reproducibility" and set the seed value to 1.
9. Select the algorithm "Random Forest" and set the option corresponding to the maximum number of trees to 50.
10. Select the phase definition object "PhaseDef_1" in the secondary tree menu and press the button "Classify". <img src="/assets/042-shuffle.png" alt="drawing" width="18"/> 
11. Select a mask file to display the mineral map.
12. Check the results of the classification (for Random Forest):
     - Are all training pixels classified in the true class? If not, the training set should be adjusted accordingly.
     - Is the out-of-bag classification error reaching a value of zero when the number of grown trees is exceeding 20? If not, there is probably a problem in the phase definition.
     - Check the predictor importance; maps with a very low predictor importance can be eliminated without affecting the quality of the classification (optional).
     - Evaluate the quality of the classification by displaying 1-2 diagnostic elements for each class (e.g. Si for biotite, quartz, plagioclase).
     - If necessary, adjust the training set and perform a new classification. It is recommended to eliminate the mask files that are not used.
13. Save your project.

### Extracting mineral modes

1. Select a mask file.
2. Select the ROI shape "rectangle" using the dropdown menu in "Mask analysis and visualization"
3. Press the "Add a ROI to export mask modes" button and immediately click and drag over the map to create the ROI. <img src="/assets/093-binoculars.png" alt="drawing" width="18"/>
4. Adjust the shape to obtain the modes of the entire map. __If the editing mode is disabled, press once the "Ctrl" key__ on your keyboard and try again editing the shape of the ROI.
5. Save the modes using the button save in the composition tab on the right. <img src="/assets/022-save.png" alt="drawing" width="18"/>  
6. Note that you can also copy the data to the clipboard using the button copy. Paste the data in a spreadsheet software program. <img src="/assets/093-binoculars.png" alt="drawing" width="18"/>
7. Eliminate the ROI using the function "Reset ROI". <img src="/assets/276-trash.png" alt="drawing" width="18"/>
8. For comparaison purposes (don't use that method for publications!), calculate pseudo modes using the point counting method:
     - Set the number of points to 500.
     - Unselect the Monte-Carlo option.
     - Extract several successive sets of pseudo modes using the point counting method by clicking on the "Generate pseudo-modes" button and copy the results in a spreadsheet software program. _Note: now you know why this method should not be used._ <img src="/assets/090-share.png" alt="drawing" width="18"/> 
9. Calculate pseudo modes using the point counting method and Monte Carlo to calculate uncertainties on the results (_note: what is never done with point counting_):
     - Set the number of points to 300.
     - Select the Monte-Carlo optionExtract pseudo modes and uncertainties using the "Generate pseudo-modes" button and copy the results in a spreadsheet software program. <img src="/assets/090-share.png" alt="drawing" width="18"/>
     - You can repeat this calculation for several number of points (e.g. 500, 750, 1000) and copy the results in a spreadsheet software program.

### Analytical standardisation

The analytical standardisation consists of transforming the intensity maps of elements into weight percent maps of oxides. XMapTools 4 includes a calibration module that performs an automated calibration of all minerals. This black box algorithm works ok when all phases have spot analyses to be used as internal standard and when intensities are heigh enough. However, you need to carefully check the results of the calibration for each mineral. 

The calibration method used by XMapTools is described in Lanari, P., Vho, A., Bovay, T., Airaghi, L., Centrella, S., (2019). Quantitative compositional mapping of mineral phases by electron probe micro-analyser. _Geological Society of London, Special Publication_, __478__, 39-63 [<a href="https://pierrelanari.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2019_LanariMapping_GSL.pdf" target="_blank">Download</a>].



### Extracting Local bulk compositions

1. Set the active workspace to "CALIBRATE".
2. Display an intensity map showing a maximum of minerals (e.g. Al).
3. Select the option "Import standards.txt" in "EPMA STANDARD DATA". 
4. Click on the "Import" button. Note that the color of the spot labels can be changed in the options of the "Project & Import" workspace. <img src="/assets/141-radar.png" alt="drawing" width="18"/>
5. Select the element Mg to estimate the quality of the position. The diagrams on the right show correlation maps with the center of the image being the position of the spots on the map. In this case the original position is good and there is no need to change it. (Optional) you can try to shift the spot position in the correlation plot of the element and then to press "apply". To restore the original position, you can simply load the standard data again using the import function. <img src="/assets/044-repeat.png" alt="drawing" width="18"/> <img src="/assets/141-radar.png" alt="drawing" width="18"/>
6. Add two additional internal standard values for quartz (not measured):
     - Display the silicon map by selecting Si in the primary tree menu.
     - Select the category "Standards (Spots)" in the secondary tree menu.
     - Adjust the view using zoom and pan (optional)
     - Press the "Add" button available in the "CALIBRATE" workspace select a pixel of quartz by clicking on the main image. <img src="/assets/056-plus.png" alt="drawing" width="18"/> 
     - Set the composition to 100 wt% of SiO2 in the table available in the "Standard" tab.
     - Note that the new standard is listed at the bottom of the secondary tree menu under "Standards (Spots)". Selecting this internal standard display the location and the composition. 
7. Calibrate the intensity element maps into maps of wt% of oxide:
     - Select a mask file in the secondary tree menu.
     - In the "CALIBRATE" workspace, press the button "Calibrate" to open the Calibration assistant for EPMA data. <img src="/assets/010-record.png" alt="drawing" width="18"/> 
     - Check the calibration curves by displaying the curve for each element of each mineral.
     - Use the button "Adjust (Manual)" to modify the calibration curve in case the calibration algorithm failed to set a proper calibration curveSelect the option "Apply to all masks".
     - Press the button "Apply Standardization"  to calibrate all maps and send the data to XMapTools.
8. Check the calibrated maps and the merged map using the primary tree menu.
9. If the calibration quality is not good, select the category "Quanti" in the primary tree menu, then right-click on the name and select "Clear All" (optional). This will eliminate all the data in this category. You can do the same for the category "Merged".

_Note: The video tutorial (see above) provides more tricks and explanations about the calibration module and how to check the quality of the calibration curves._
