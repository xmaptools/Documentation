### Dataset description

The dataset used in this tutorial comes from the study of Duesterhoeft & Lanari (2020). It consists of EPMA maps of the sample HAL104 from West Guilford (Ontario) of the Canadian Grenville Province. It was analysed using 15 KeV accelerating voltage, 100 nA specimen current, 130 ms dwell time, 20 µm step size, ~1 µm beam size with 1000*1000 pixels. The mapping time was ~75 h.

Please do not use these data for any other purpose than this tutorial without the explicit authorisation of the author(s).

### How to get started?

1. Download Tutorial_EPMA_2023.zip from the <a href="https://cloud.cpag-research.ch/index.php/s/HtL8eMuZFmgxluz" target="_blank">download center</a>.
2. Unzip the folder in a suitable working directory (e.g. Documents/Mapping/EPMA/__Tutorial_EPMA_2023/__)
3. Open XMapTools. Note that starting XMapTools can take up to a minute; restarting the program is slightly faster
When the program is ready, a dialog box opens; pick the working directory __Tutorial_EPMA_2023__ and click the button “Open”. You can change the working directory later, but you need to pick a directory when you start the program. A log file is automatically created in the selected working directory.
