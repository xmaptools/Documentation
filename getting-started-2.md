# Opening XMapTools for the First Time

1. Open the XMapTools app. **Note:** it may take up to a minute to start the first time while MATLAB libraries are loaded. XMapTools will start slightly faster on subsequent launches (until you restart your computer).

2. A dialogue box opens — select your **working directory** and press **Open**. A working directory contains the data for a specific project. XMapTools automatically generates files during use that are stored there. Although you can change the working directory later, you must select one at startup. A log file is also automatically created in the selected working directory.

3. The current working directory is displayed in the top bar of the main window.

4. You are now ready to go! You can start converting raw data or importing maps.

# Common Questions

## Why do I have to choose a working directory?

XMapTools creates many files during data processing and it is better to store these files together with the data they belong to.

It is strongly recommended to have a folder for each project that contains only the map and standard files needed by XMapTools. Raw data should be stored in a separate folder.

## Why does it take so long to start XMapTools?

All the MATLAB libraries need to be loaded, which takes some time. The second time you run XMapTools it will be faster if you haven't restarted your computer. Use this time to think about your project and perhaps grab a cup of tea or coffee.
