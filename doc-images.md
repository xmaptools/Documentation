# Images

*Based on XMapTools 4.5 embedded documentation – Help file version 14.01.2024*

---

This page describes the **Images** module, which provides tools to create and manage publication-ready images from XMapTools data.

## What are "Image-Data" in XMapTools?

Images are plots stored in the project file and can be accessed from the primary menu under the *Image* category. These plots can be created using the tools available in the *Image* menu. They can be edited at any time and changes are saved.

Four types of images can be created:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Single plot image** | A single map (e.g. Ca_apfu in garnet) |
| **Multi-plot image** | A mosaic of maps (e.g. SiO2, Al2O3, FeO, Na2O); can also be combined into a GIF |
| **Multi-layer image (shared scale)** | Multiple layers plotted with the same colour bar (e.g. XMg in biotite and garnet) |
| **Multi-layer image (multi-scale)** | Multiple layers, each plotted with its own colour scale and palette |


## How to Create and Edit Images

### Single-Plot Image

Use the main menu to view a map and, if necessary, adjust the colour contrast using the live histogram. Select *Image >> Add Current Image* from the main menu. A new image object will be created and placed in the *Image* category at the bottom of the primary menu.

You can view this image at any time by selecting *Img (single-layer) #X* from the primary menu (where X is the number of the image).

To edit the image, expand the image object and select the map. You can adjust the colour settings (borders, colour palette, etc.); changes are saved within the image object.

To export the image, select the image item in the primary menu and choose *File > Save Image* or *Edit > Copy Image* from the menu.

### Multi-Plot Image

1. Activate multi-selection mode from the *Image > Multi-Selection Mode* menu. The item labels in the primary menu are displayed in blue when this mode is active
2. Select multiple maps from the primary menu. A mosaic will be created and displayed in the main window
3. Select *Image > Add Multi-Plot Image* from the menu

You can expand the *Img (multi-plot) #X* item in the primary menu and select the maps one by one to adjust the colour contrast. You can also change the colour palette in the *Options* panel.

::: warning
It is not recommended to use XMapTools with multi-selection mode enabled for normal operation — it should only be used to generate images.

### Multi-Plot Image & GIF

A GIF can be created from a multi-plot image. Select a multi-plot object, right-click on the name and select *Save as GIF*.

### Multi-Layer Image (Shared Scale)

1. Activate multi-selection mode from the *Image > Multi-Selection Mode* menu
2. Select two (or more) compatible maps to plot together, for example XMg in biotite and XMg in garnet. The same unit should be used
3. Select *Image > Add Multi-Layer Image (Shared Scale)* from the menu

You can expand the *Img (multi-layer ShS) #X* item in the primary menu and select the maps one by one to adjust the colour contrast. The same minimum and maximum values are applied to both images.

### Multi-Layer Image (Multi-Scale)

1. Activate multi-selection mode from the *Image > Multi-Selection Mode* menu
2. Select two (or more) maps to be plotted together. Different quantities with different scales and units can be selected
3. Select *Image > Add Multi-Layer Image (Multi-Scale)* from the menu

It is strongly recommended to use a different colour map for each map, as multiple colour bars will be created.
