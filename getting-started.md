# Getting Started

Welcome to the XMapTools documentation! Whether you are a new or returning user, this guide will help you get XMapTools 4.5 up and running.

The installation and update procedures have changed in XMapTools 4.5. Most binaries now require **MATLAB Runtime 25.1**, which is installed automatically by the XMapTools installer. Older Runtime versions (e.g. v99 or v912) are no longer needed and can be safely deleted after upgrading.

XMapTools is distributed via shell scripts for [macOS](/installation_guide#macos) and [Windows](/installation_guide#windows) that automate the installation, update, download, extraction, and configuration of the program.

## Compatibility

Before installing, make sure your system meets the requirements below:

| Version | Processor | Operating System | Runtime |
|---|---|---|---|
| **macOS** | Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3, M4, …) | macOS Sequoia (15), Sonoma (14), or Ventura (13) | R2025a (25.1) |
| **macOS Intel** | Intel | macOS Sequoia (15), Sonoma (14), or Ventura (13) | R2020b (v99) |
| **Windows** | x86-64 | Windows 10 or Windows 11 | R2025a (25.1) |

> **Note:** The macOS version is **not** compatible with Intel processors, and the macOS Intel version is **not** stable with Apple Silicon processors. The installer auto-detects your architecture.
